# DDD Printable Wall Control Centerpiece Tool Hooks

Centerpiece tool hooks designed for specific tool applications.

## Centerpiece Tool Hooks Naming

Centerpiece names start with the dimensions, roughly equivalent to inches as used on the Wall Control system.  A 2x4 Centerpiece is 2in in height and fits between sidepieces that are 4in apart.

## Centerpiece Tool Hooks

* ### 3x7 Benchtop Hand Tool [Tray](3x7%20Benchtop%20Hand%20Tool%20Holder%20Tray.stl) and [Holder](3x7%20Benchtop%20Hand%20Tool%20Holder.stl)

* ### [11pc Wrench Hangers](1x6%2011pc%20Wrench%20Hanger.stl)

  Holds an 11 piece set of SAE box-end wrenches, combine with the [Inverted model](1x6%2011pc%20Wrench%20Hanger%20Inverted.stl) to hold a [22 piece set like this](https://amzn.to/35fa7dd).  Print with a left/right/center set of [6x0 Flats](../../Sidepieces/Flats) and at least 8x [4x10x8mm Pins](../Spacer_blank_flush/4x10x8mm%20Pin.stl).

* ### [2x4 10x](2x4%2010x%2010mm%20Screwdriver%20Holder.stl) and [2x5 13x 10mm Screwdriver Holder](2x5%2013x%2010mm%20Screwdriver%20Holder.stl)

  Holds 10x or 13x 10mm-wide screwdrivers (or similar).  I like [Wiha precision tools](https://amzn.to/2GQ8ucA) and these were designed to fit.  Combine with [2x2 L Brackets](../../Sidepieces/L_brackets/) and a [2x5 spacer](../../Centerpieces/Spacer_perforated/2x5%20Spacer%20perforated.stl).

* ### Chinese Digital Calipers [150mm](1x3%20Chinese%20Digital%20Calipers%20150mm.stl) and [300mm](1x3%20Chinese%20Digital%20Calipers%20300mm.stl)

* ### Milwaukee M12 Battery holder for [one](2x2_milwaukee_M12_battery_x1.stl), [two](2x5_milwaukee_M12_battery_x2.stl), or [three](2x8_milwaukee_M12_battery_x3.stl) batteries

  Holders for M12 Milwaukee batteries. Each one requires [2x0 Flat Left](../../Sidepieces/Flats/2x0%20Flat%20Left.stl) and [2x0 Flat Right](../../Sidepieces/Flats/2x0%20Flat%20Right.stl) sidepieces along with 4 of the [4x10x8mm pins](../../Accessories/4x10x8mm%20Pin.stl). Photos available in my [Printables page](https://www.printables.com/model/352898-milwaukee-m12-battery-holder-for-wall-control-pegb). These were remixed from [Yangorang's design](https://www.printables.com/model/75300-power-tool-battery-wall-control-pegboard-mounts-fo) which requires nuts and bolts - whereas the version here is fully printable.
  
* ### Milwaukee M12 Generic Tool holders
  These are tool holders that should work for almost all Milwaukee M12 tools, although you should mind how heavy the tools are. There are several variations for holding the tools sideways and flat agains the pegboard (better for heavier tools) and angled ones where the tool points away from the wall:
    * [Straight](2x1_Milwaukee_M12_tool_holder_straight.stl): tool is held vertically and parallel to the wall, likelly better for some heavier tools since it won't stress the sidepiece hooks as much.
    * [Straight Extended](2x1_Milwaukee_M12_tool_holder_straight_extended.stl): Same as straight, but arm juts out further from pegboard for wider tools.
    * [Angled](2x1_Milwaukee_M12_tool_holder_angled.stl): 
  Each one requires [2x0 Flat Left](../../Sidepieces/Flats/2x0%20Flat%20Left.stl) and [2x0 Flat Right](../../Sidepieces/Flats/2x0%20Flat%20Right.stl) sidepieces along with 4 of the [4x10x8mm pins](../../Accessories/4x10x8mm%20Pin.stl). Photos available in my [Printables page](https://www.printables.com/model/352915-milwaukee-m12-tool-holders-for-wall-control-pegboa). These were remixed from [Yangorang's design](https://www.printables.com/model/75300-power-tool-battery-wall-control-pegboard-mounts-fo) which requires nuts and bolts - whereas the version here is fully printable. It also has added reinforcement on the arms.
  
  * ### [2.25x2 Milwaukee 3/8" Cordless Ratchet](2x2%20Milwaukee%203-8%20Cordless%20Ratchet.stl)

  Holders for the [Wiha 33496 8-Piece T-Handle Hex Driver set](https://amzn.to/36gpuRK), split into two parts.  The [larger set](1x3%20Wiha%20T-Handle%20M10%20M8%20M6%20M5.stl) needs to be set 3" away from the panel for the T-Handles to fit, so pair with [2x3 Angle Brackets](../../Sidepieces/Angle_brackets/) and a [2x4 spacer](../../Centerpieces/Spacer_perforated/2x4%20Spacer%20perforated.stl).  The [smaller set](1x4%20Wiha%20T-Handle%20M4%20M3%20M2.5%20M2.stl) can set closer to the wall if desired, using [2x2 Angle Brackets](../../Sidepieces/Angle_brackets/) and a [2x3 spacer](../../Centerpieces/Spacer_perforated/2x3%20Spacer%20perforated.stl).

* ### Wera 5023451001 10-Piece Imperial T-Handle Hex Plus Drivers ([Large drivers](2x5%20Wera%20HexPlus%20T-Handle%20Imperial%20Large.stl) and [Small drivers](2x4%20Wera%20HexPlus%20T-Handle%20Imperial%20Small.stl))

Pair with [2x2 Angle Brackets](../../Sidepieces/Angle_brackets/) and a [2x5 spacer](../../Centerpieces/Spacer_perforated/2x5%20Spacer%20perforated.stl) for the larger 5 drivers, and a [2x4 spacer](../../Centerpieces/Spacer_perforated/2x5%20Spacer%20perforated.stl) for the smaller 5 drivers

  Holds a set of [6 drivers from the Wera 917 and 916 Chiseldrivers](https://amzn.to/35iAoXX) (1/2/3 Phillips and Pozidriv).  Print with [2x2 Angle Brackets](../../Sidepieces/Angle_brackets/) and a [2x6 spacer](../../Centerpieces/Spacer_perforated/2x5%20Spacer%20perforated.stl).  The 6" span on this needs some strength, I recommend printing this one with 100% perimeters.  It'll take a while to print but the result will be plenty rigid.

* ### [Wera Kraftform 923 slotted Chiseldrivers](2x5%20Wera%20932.stl)

  Mount for the [Milwaukee M12 Charger](https://amzn.to/375AkL7) with locking feature, used for all M12 tools from Milwaukee.  Combine with [2x0 Flat Brackets](../../Sidepieces/Flats/), 4x [4x10x8mm Pins](../Spacer_blank_flush/4x10x8mm%20Pin.stl), and two [8mm Lock Pins](../../Centerpieces/Locking_spacer/8mm%20Lock%20Pin.stl) to keep it in place.

  Mount for the [Milwaukee M12 FUEL Installation Drill/Driver](https://amzn.to/3KmtOTe). Combine with Left/Right [3x0 Flat Brackets](../../Sidepieces/Flats/) to keep it in place. The [lock piece](3x2%20Milwaukee%20M12%20Installation%20Drill%20Lock.stl) is definitely optional.

## Printing notes

In most use cases, the centerpieces are loaded with a bending moment, which is only really a problem when using the longer (4"+) models.  Adding perimeters and infill can help with rigidity, but for most cases simply printing fast and cheap should work fine.  PLA is a good choice for maximum rigidity.
