# DDD Printable Wall Control Centerpieces

![Centerpiece Spacers](https://github.com/aderusha/DDD-Printable-Wall-Control-System/blob/main/images/DDD_Printable_Wall_Control_Centerpiece_Spacers.png?raw=true)

Centerpieces mount between sidepieces to create a custom hanging solution by combining snap-fit modular components.

## Centerpiece Naming

Centerpiece names start with the dimensions, roughly equivalent to inches as used on the Wall Control system.  A 2x4 Centerpiece is 2in in height and fits between sidepieces that are 4in apart.

## Centerpiece Models

### [Tool_hooks](Tool_hooks/)

Centerpiece models designed for specific tools and applications.

### [Locking Spacer](Locking_spacer/)

Spacers with threads for the [8mm Lock Pin](Locking_spacer/8mm%20Lock%20Pin.stl) which will lock the assembled hanger to the Wall Control board.  Use these as vertical spacers between your sidepieces to create a solid mounting solution for nearly anything.

### [Locking Spacer for Horizontal Wall Control](Locking_spacer_for_horizontal_Wall_Control/)

Same as above, but for Horizontal Wall Control panels which have a different hole pattern.

### [Spacer Blank](Spacer_blank/)

Simple, blank models with connection pins on either side in various sizes.  Great choice for horizontal use as a shelf.

### [Spacer Blank Flush](Spacer_blank_flush/)

These spacers mount flush to both the back and front of the side pieces, which requires the use of 4 or 6 [4x10x8mm Pins](4x10x8mm Pin.stl) along the edges to connect them to a sidepiece. Another good choice for horizontal use as a shelf, I've also used these parts mounted vertically to provide a large flat surface for attaching adhesive-backed Velcro strips.

### [Clip-on Spacer](Spacer_clip-on/)

Another flush-mount design requiring 4 or 6 [4x10x8mm Pins](../Accessories/4x10x8mm%20Pin.stl) for mounting between side pieces.  The clip-on spacer provides a vertical surface set a few mm away from the wall panel so that one can mount clip-on parts such as a tape measure.

### [U hooks](U_hooks/)

U hooks useful for mounting horizontally between side pieces to hang tools.

### [Spacer Perforated](Spacer_perforated/)

Models with 1/2" and 1" holes along the flat surface for additional rigidity, interesting aesthetics, or to hold things with 1/2" or 1" round features.

## Printing notes

In most use cases, the centerpieces are loaded with a bending moment, which is only really a problem when using the longer (4"+) models.  Adding infill and perimeters can help with rigidity, but for most cases simply printing fast and cheap should work fine.  PLA is a good choice for maximum rigidity.
