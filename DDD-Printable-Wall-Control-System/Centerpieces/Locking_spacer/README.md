The locking spacer models provide an array of threaded holes which align with the 1/4" pegboard holes on a Wall Control panel.  Once mounted to the panel, you can screw in a [positive-lock pin](./8mm%20Lock%20Pin.stl) which securely anchors the model to a wall control panel in all 3 axis.  The pin has a cutout for a 1/4" square drive to screw it into the spacer.
