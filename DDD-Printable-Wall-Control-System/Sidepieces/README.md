# DDD Printable Wall Control Sidepieces

![Sidepieces](https://github.com/aderusha/DDD-Printable-Wall-Control-System/blob/main/images/DDD_Printable_Wall_Control_Sidepieces.png?raw=true)

Sidepieces are used to connect to the Wall Control through the 1in slots and extend forward out from the wall.  Sidepieces can work on their own with a retainer which can be useful to create a single hook.  Alternately, sidepieces can be hooked together via centerpieces to create a wide range of modular hanging solutions.

## Sidepiece Naming

Sidepiece names start with the dimensions, roughly equivalent to inches as used on the Wall Control system.  For example, a 2x4 Sidepiece is 2in in height and extends 4in out from the base (which itself is 8.8mm in front of the wall panel).

## Sidepiece Models

### [Retainers](Retainers/)

Retainers are used when a sidepiece is used without one or more centerpieces, providing a secure fit against the Wall Control board.  Standard retainer models are narrow enough to allow side-by-side placement with an adjacent sidepiece + retainer.  Locking retainers are wider but can be used with the [8mm lock pin](Retainers/8mm%20Lock%20Pin.stl) to lock the hanger to the panel. Models are provided in 2/3/4/5/6 inch heights.

### [Flats](Flats/)

Simple, flat-surface sidepieces allowing centerpieces to be mounted vertically against the Wall Control board.  Useful with flush-mounted Centerpieces.

### [L Brackets](L_brackets)

"L" shaped brackets, good for lightweight loads or for use as hooks.  Models are available with a flat top, or with a 1/4" round "hook" feature which can help to retain parts hung on these models.

### [Angle Brackets](Angle_brackets)

Angle brackets good for holding moderate loads, general-purpose solution for mounting centerpieces horizontally.  Available in "flat" or "hook" variations.

### [Square Brackets](Square_brackets/)

Square brackets good for holding heavy loads.  With a full complement of centerpieces mounted between two square brackets, one can create a "torsion box" which can be helpful for mounting things which might be hanging off to one side of the hanger, presenting a twisting force on the bracket.  Available in "flat" or "hook" variations.

### [U Brackets](U_brackets/.)

U brackets are useful as "hooks" for mounting nearly anything.  Use with a [retainer](Retainers/) to create a single hook which is useful for hanging power tools, or combine a left/right pair of U brackets to hang a drill.

### [Dowel Rod Hangers](Dowel_rod_hanger/.)

Hangers to hold dowel rods, allowing one to mount things with a transverse hole such as spools.

## Printing notes

The sidepieces bear most of the load for an assembled hanger solution.  The downward forces press up against a catch on the bottom of the slot hook on each sidepiece, while the outward and rotational forces pull against the top-most portion of that same catch.  I've found printing with 100% perimeters in the catch area provides the strongest print. PLA is a good choice for maximum rigidity.
